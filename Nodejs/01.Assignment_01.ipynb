    "Ans: Applying a similar concept to the project structuring of Express, the separation of the application logic from the server allows the code to be modular and follow a MVC (Model-View-Controller) model. The separation is essential to reduce coupling and to encapsulate and abstract the inside logic of application.\n",

    "     App: The ‘app’ file contain the main business logic of the web application and is responsible for its execution. It also contains access to the backend database and data models. The ‘app’ consists of two main components – routes and controllers. \n",
    "     \n",
    "Advantage of ‘server’ and ‘app’ separation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Abstraction and Encapsulation: \n",
    "                                    While the server consists only of logic that deals with server configuration, setting up the middleware and initializing the routes, the app takes care of the application logic and abstracts the data model and business logic from the server layer. This ensures that the database/data is abstracted from the server layer and encapsulated by the application layer.\n",
    "Modularity: \n",
    "            By keeping the server and app functionalities separate, the code is divided into multiple modules, each having a single task or responsibility to perform. These can be individually used whenever required as there is a reduced dependency between modules. Duplicate code can be avoided through a clear separation of logic.\n",
    "Scalability: \n",
    "            Each individual component is assigned a unique responsibility. This allows changes to be made quickly without having to make changes everywhere in the code. For example, consider the logic of a module that is to be changed, which is being used as a submodule in several other functions. If the logic is a separate module, the change would only have to be made in that one module, instead of all the functions in which the usage of logic occurs.\n",
    "Reusability: \n",
    "            Since the application is divided into multiple modules that are assigned a single task, they can be reused in the application multiple times whenever the need be. For example, an application requiring the conversion of minutes into seconds multiple times might define this conversion as a separate function, to avoid the hassle of re-writing the logic throughout the application again and again."
